[Gourmet Service Objects][] is a post worth returning to from time to time.
After slogging through some code to understand what it did, I wrote it into
a service. The code wasn't substantially different, but the fact that it had
a name as first-class citizen instantly made it easier to understand.

Because my dudepal [@jabronus][] gave me an SVG of my avatar, I started
learning how to use SVG in the browser. I even made my avatar blink using CSS
animations. Supes cool.

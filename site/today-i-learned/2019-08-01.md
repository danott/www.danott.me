Updating for security vulnerabilities with yarn can be tricky.
For example, I got a Github warning that my version of `js-yaml` needed to be updated.
`js-yaml` does not appear in my `package.json`.
It is one of my dependencies' dependencies.

`yarn update js-yaml@secure-version` adds `js-yaml` into my dependencies, which is not what I want to communicate to the team.

Trying to solve for this communication problem brought me to Yarn's [selective dependency resolutions][].
This seems to fit the exact bill of what I'm trying to achieve.
Among the reason's to use selective dependency resolution is listed:

> A sub-dependency of your project got an important security update and you don’t want to wait for your direct-dependency to issue a minimum version update.

Force `yarn.lock` to update appropriately, without communicating to a future maintainer that this is actually a dependency of our app.
Works on my machine.

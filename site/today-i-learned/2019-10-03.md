I'm intentionally slow to script things away in my day-to-day development.
I understand the benefits of scripting away repetitive tasks.
But I've found that they come at the cost of empathy.

I used to have an alias of `be` for running `bundle exec`.
When I'd pair with newer developers, they'd begin to think that `be` is a command they should know, when in fact it was a customization they'd need to borrow.
So I've formed the habit of always typing out `bundle exec`.

It takes a little more time.
But when someone is looking over my shoulder, they're learning how to do do the thing rather than learning my abstraction about how to do the thing.

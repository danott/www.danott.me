While authoring a very boring HTML form I learned that you do not need a `for`/`id` pair on a label that is wrapping a radio input.

```diff
-<label for="radio_option_1">
-  <input id="radio_option_1" type="radio" name="cheese" value="cheddar"> Cheddar
+<label>
+  <input type="radio" name="cheese" value="cheddar"> Cheddar
```

My dude pal [@jabronus][] lent me this one. It was a super quick read of practical advice from a startup that is doing well for themselves. Think 37 Signals’ “Getting Real”, but from a company that favors the VC path instead of being animatedly opposed to it. Lots of helpful anecdotes from their six years in business. Would recommend it in tandem with “Getting Real” to someone who wants to start something to establish a baseline of diverse opinions for how they can choose to operate their thing.

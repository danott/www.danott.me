I dabbled into some fiction.
Because it had to do vaguely with software teams.

The characters are all caricatures.
What's great about caricatures is that they're recognizable.
Surely you'll find at least one recognition.

What can I say.
It was goofy, in the best ways.
I enjoyed it.
Take it to a beach, and get lost in work.

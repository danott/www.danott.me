This collection of essays is very good. What I found most valuable is Kosuke’s willingness to share his raw experience and meditations in the wake of the nuclear bombing of Japan. His starting point of reference is much different than a typical westerner, which makes for a great opportunity to listen and learn. A work I’ll return to again.

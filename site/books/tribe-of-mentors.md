I forgot about this book.
For a while.
I recall reading it in July of 2019, laying on bed in Seattle.
Finally finished it in November of 2020.

I'm not super familiar with Tim's body of work.
The Four Hour Workweek.
The podcast show.
But nonetheless, this one was fun.

I don't remember anybody's advice.
Lots of platitudes, rapid fire, get lost quickly.
But I mostly love the idea of cold calling Terry Crews, and getting a meaningful reply.

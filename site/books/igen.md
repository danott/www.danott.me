Millennials are over.
It's all about iGen now.

While I found this book interesting, I am skeptical about it's conclusions.
The methods of measurement appear to be sound.
The historical comparisons appear to be fair.
My skepticism is that the dataset is too small, or the age of the subjects is still too malleable.
Like any abstraction, it feels like it may be too early to say what this next generation will value.

Overall, it was an interesting read.
The single-generation contrast between Millennials and iGen was non-intuitive, which gave me a re-appreciation for _Thinking Fast and Slow_, and how bad we actually are at intuition in some cases.
It'll be interesting to re-visit in a few years, as this generation is more integrated into the work force and institutions.

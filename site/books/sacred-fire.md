I enjoyed this book, but I don’t feel compelled to recommend it. Mostly because I feel like what is communicated could be conveyed in about a third of the page count. That said, the words themselves challenge our cultural assumptions of productivity, utility, and efficiency as the measure of a life’s value, so maybe that’s the meta point. Transmitting the idea that your life will change as you age is not shocking, but Ronald communicates this truth in an illuminating way. Okay, maybe I do recommend it because it’s got me thinking.

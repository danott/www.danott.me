This one sat on the shelf for way too many years before finally reading.
Frank has that way of talking in the abstract that allows your mind to find the concrete applications in your own life.
It might be found lacking on practical advice for making day-to-day design decisions.
But Frank is digging deeper, guiding us towards the foundational principles that will in turn make day-to-day decisions automatic.

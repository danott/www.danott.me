I don’t know where to start. Every page is ripe with fascination. So many threads to pull on. Morality. Philosophy. History. Religion. Economy. It’s all there in approachable language, and all given the fair weight each deserves.

David has the pedigree to lay out in detail the things I’ve been musing in my gut. Language of debt pervades our everyday life. Money is a deeply religious endeavor, with it’s own ex nihilo to boot. While mostly a secular work, it’s bringing me deeper levels of contemplation to Jesus’ postulation that you cannot serve both God and mammon.
I highly recommend this book to anybody that find these concepts even remotely interesting.

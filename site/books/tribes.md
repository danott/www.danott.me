This book has been receiving high praise for 10 years, so I was excited to give it a listen. I was underwhelmed by this collection of anecdotes and analogies. Seth fleshes out his ideas on his blog, and that style of writing comes through in this work that seems to lack a strong thread. With its common contradictions and analogies that cannot withstand even the slightest exercise in extrapolation, it’s hard to find anything to hold on to. A critique that is not unique to this book; I grow tired of all the self-help leadership books that appropriate any pop-culture success as employing their ideas. The most compelling part of this work is that Seth makes you feel like you can accomplish everything without saying anything. Leadership is a choice. Challenge entrenched ideas. Motivational: yes. Substance: meh.

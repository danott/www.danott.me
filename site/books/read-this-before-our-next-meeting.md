I have the luxury of not attending many meetings.
The conflict of the book doesn't resonate with me presently but I am reminded of times when it would have.

The big takeaways I have is that decisions should be made by individuals.
Not in isolation.
But in ownership.
One person should be responsible for a decision.
If you're not open to defending or colleagues challenging your decision don't invite a meeting.

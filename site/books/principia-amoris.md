An academic book that felt mostly targeted at academics and practitioners.
The love equations predicting the happiness and final outcome of a marriage have a high degree of accuracy.
What I appreciated about Gottman was his love for mathematics, but also for not dehumanizing the subjects.
The practical steps of how to change your variables were much appreciated.

The biggest things I remember are:

- Accept every bid you can
- Try to have positive startup in conflicts
- Repair early and often when miscommunication or regrettable interactions happen

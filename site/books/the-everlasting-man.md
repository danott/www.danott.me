I started this in November 2018, then again in October 2019. More like the everlasting read, amirite?
I had high hopes for this because Orthodoxy was very impactful when read a decade prior. Chesterton remains a challenging thinker, but this one was tough to pick up each day. The difficulty comes from Chesterton offering a new analogy in every paragraph. While each vignette is poignant and quotable in isolation, the larger intent gets lost in the shuffle of competing allegories without a thread keeping them attached.

Maybe I’ll try again in a quieter future. For now, I’d refer you back to Orthodoxy if you want the check out this articulate Catholic thinker from the past century.

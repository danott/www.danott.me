Dr. Sleeth’s stories from the emergency room would be an interesting read on their own. Leveraging that presumably stressful environment to point towards the necessity and ability to find radical rest makes the “24/6” life seem attainable and desirable.

In the shortest summary, this book is about the fourth commandment: remember the sabbath day and keep it holy. In a world that operates non-stop, choose to stop one day a week, and reap the benefits.

History of this commandment’s distortion are replaced with the invitation for restoration at the heart. Sleeth’s suggestions are more descriptive than prescriptive, which is very welcome for an idea which has historically had burdens piled atop.

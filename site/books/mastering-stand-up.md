My friend participated at an open mic night at a comedy club, which made me want to participate at an open mic night at a comedy club. Increasingly a researcher, I picked this one up from the library to see if I’m actually interested in stand up, or it was a fleeting feeling. Lots of similar themes to other books I’ve been reading this year. There are no short cuts. Write things down. Produce first drafts. Then edit them vigorously. A quick read over the weekend, it felt like a great introduction to a deep world of becoming a master of a craft.

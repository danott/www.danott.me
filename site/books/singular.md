There’s something special about reading a book when you know how long the author labored over it.
It was about two years ago to the day when I remember Zack sharing his new pursuit over lunch.

The story was a great balance of teenage nostalgia and philosophical depth.
If we could preserve consciousness without experiencing the pains of the day to day, do we lose anything? How much of who we are is nature vs nurture?

Some deep questions of life are presented through a compelling narrative, but no conclusions are demanded of the reader.
The space is left for contemplation, and enjoying the discovery over a nice glass of whisky.

The Manual is a collection of six authors providing a thought and a lesson. I purchased issues one through three in 2012, as they were first published. Volume three is no longer in print, but I do happen to have one on my shelf.

The content stands the test of five years time, as it still captivated thought and found applications in creative work today. The content is compelling at the time of reading, but the short format lacks a stickiness for retaining the ideas.

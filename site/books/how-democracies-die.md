I read this book and it was enjoyable. I don’t consider myself very engaged in politics, but I find the high level descriptions and history of politics engaging. This was an approachable book that is helpful in shaping an understanding of the current political climate in our country. Was also a good gut check that America can learn from the democratic struggles of other countries. Depressing suggestions of an authoritarian future in the middle, but ended on a hopeful note for practical actions to maintain democracy. No work is without bias, so your enjoyment mileage may very. 🤓

The book club I’ve participated in was going to read this. I couldn’t make the meeting time, but I decided to read it anyway. Good choice, because this book was excellent. It shared some of the laments offered in How Democracies Die, but offered a substantially more proactive approach to steps we can take to restore the democratic ideals of the past. Basically: people over profits, stakeholders over shareholders, etc. There’s a proper place for truth, relativism, honor, and shame. A quick read that will leave a lasting impression on readers and their communities. I definitely recommend this one.

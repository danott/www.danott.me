A thorough re-telling of the events that happened in Columbine.
How the media handled it.
How the church handled it.
How psychopaths work.

So much of what made things confusing in the aftermath is that people didn't tell the truth.
The media and the church both preferred narratives to facts.
It may have resulted in short-term gains in viewership and parishioners, in the long run it damages reputations.

Tim Keller and his wife Kathy communicate their biblical convictions about the purpose and praxis of marriage. While some readers might find their conclusions antiquated or incompatible with recent thought, the medium of gentleness carries the message to all ears who are truly as tolerant as they herald. Equal parts anecdote, experience, and exposition, this is a very practical book for individuals or couples who want their understanding of marriage to be shaped by considered and researched Christian thought.

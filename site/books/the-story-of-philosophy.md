I didn’t want this one to end. The philosophies of individuals, the environments that fostered them, the conclusions (un)realized by embracing them as the bedrock of belief is infinitely fascinating. I have little frame of reference for the wide world of philosophy, but it felt like the author gave a fair introduction to all the people covered, finding appreciation for the contributions of their philosophy while not holding back the sparring punches of criticism in apparent shortcomings.

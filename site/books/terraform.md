An excellent book.
The fluid structure of essays and poetry reads the way my brain works.
A work of art that demands thought is welcome against the tired prose of precision that I'm used to.
Maybe it's self-affirming, but I found comfort in Propaganda's words that seemed to articulate big ideas I've been circling in ways that invite contemplation.

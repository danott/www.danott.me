This book wasn’t bad, but it wasn’t great either. The content was helpful despite its disorganization. The presentation was lacking a narrative that connected with this reader. The anecdotes about what happened in a pastor’s life and his congregation come across exactly as such: anecdotes that are no doubt encouraging, but leave the reader asking “okay, so what now?”.

The last few chapters have some practical advice about how to organize our days. It is my opinion that the content fails to deliver on the title of pursuing emotional health. Perhaps I am not the target audience, as I am already okay with the idea that all our emotions are a welcome barometer for what is going on, and that our families have an impact on our emotions about our emotions. I could see how the ideas could be mind-bending for folks who see emotions as black & white as “good emotions” or “bad emotions”. (It me years ago)

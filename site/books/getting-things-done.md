The information in this book could be distilled down into a brochure. In fact, there's a very brief course on LinkedIn learning that gives you the nuts and bolts to get started in a fraction of the time.

Even so, I appreciated the 10 hours of repetitive preaching on how to employ these simple things that you already know how to do. Experience is showing already that trusting the system leads to fewer stressors. I would recommend this book to anyone.

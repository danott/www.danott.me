After reading a bunch of philosophy and theology lately, this short institutional biography was a welcome retreat. Hearing the tale of academia, Lucas Film, almost Microsoft, and the many other recognizable names was fun. It’s particularly interesting to hear about companies that were growing up around the same time I was growing up. It is a bit dated, so it lacks insight into some of the more recent favorites. Enjoyment probably correlates with your interest in business operations and appreciation for Pixar’s films.

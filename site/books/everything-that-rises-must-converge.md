I picked up this one because it’s what Jacob is reading in LOST when he visits John Locke after his fall. Each short story was compelling in its own way, though I imagine the directness of the content may be too challenging for some. There’s an argument about science versus faith with a character named Shepherd, which is about the biggest connection to LOST I could find. The themes of religion and race are addressed without apologies or landing point, meant to leave you thinking. The narrators on this audio book were excellent. Now it’s time to restart LOST.

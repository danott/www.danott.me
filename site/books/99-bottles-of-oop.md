I had attended Sandi Metz's training with my Planning Center comrades in 2013, so I kind of knew what to expect from this book.
It was a good quick read about object oriented design, and a great follow up to POODIR.

Some of the refactoring in the middle chapters felt pedantic.
And self identified at that.
But, seeing the thought for thought process of code transformation without breaking functionality is a very helpful skill.

The hardest part, is knowing when code is "good enough".
Were the refactorings required to make the "six pack" requirement easy worth it?
And that's basically the conclusion of the book.
A lot of design in software is hard to measure when considering costs in running your business.

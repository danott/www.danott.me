More of the expected Basecamp philosophy, with a focus on the choices that foster a calm company. I already think very similarly to the authors so nothing is particularly revelatory or challenging. But nodding my head yes and thinking of my own blunders against calm made it a worthwhile read nonetheless. I read a library copy, but would be interested in picking up my own to highlight the pointed sentences that capture the distilled ideas.

Equal parts economics, psychology, and a touch of philosophy at the end, this book was great.
The conclusion chapter was extremely helpful for summarizing the vast amount of information that is presented and processed in this book.

The two systems.
The two species.
The two selves.

System one is automatic.
System two is effortful.
Most biases we experience are a result of system two being lazy, and trying to substitute a similar question that is readily answerable by system one.

"Econs" are rational.
"Humans" are biased.

The remembering self and the experiencing self.
What happens if you retain no memories?
We often make decisions for the remembering selves, with no guarantee of tomorrow.

Framing.
Priming.

This was a very practical read on the topic of prayer.
At first I resisted this book, because the author's style didn't mesh with my perceptions.
It felt like he spent too much time exegeting his personal life as the source of truth rather than a text.
Reading further, it became apparent that his personal experience was built on top of the solid ground of study he'd taken very seriously.

While there were many practical takeaways, I think the greatest achievement of this work is encouragement.
Paul's story of prayer growing in his life is attractive, lacks magic formulas, and most importantly comes across as attainable and sustainable.

Don't make too big a deal of the theatrics of prayer.
Don't make too small a deal of the power of prayer.

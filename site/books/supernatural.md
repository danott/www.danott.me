Borrowed this one from the irreplaceable friend that is @tdurbs. For me, coming from a background that is saturated in the tidy-small-boxes-and-buttoned-up-answers of reformed theology, the author’s take was a refreshing approach at taking the Bible at its word, and being okay with the uncomfortable complexities of passages that do not make sense or fit into our preconceived notions of how the pieces should fit together. The big idea doesn’t feel like it departs from orthodoxy in any way, but allows for some interesting interpretations in the finer details of the unseen world around us. What I appreciated the most was the pastoral heart in each chapter that communicated “why this matters”, connecting his theory to practical changes in our day to day lives that can make us better friends and neighbors.

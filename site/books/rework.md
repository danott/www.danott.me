I listened to the audiobook of this one.
I didn't start writing this note until way after.
It was a fun listen with routine ~~37 Signals~~ Basecamp mantra.

Start scrappy.
Stay small.
Stick to what you know.
Scratch your own itch.

I loved this book... but I've been following these guys for so long that the content was more reinforcing than revelatory.
